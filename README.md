Customer Loan Risk Assessment
This is the first version of the Customer Loan Risk Assessment project, where I conduct an in-depth analysis of a bank's existing loan data. The entire analysis has been meticulously executed in Microsoft Excel, providing valuable insights into loan risk and customer profiles.

Due to the file size limitation on GitHub (maximum upload size of 25 MB), I couldn't upload the Excel file here, as it is approximately 100 MB. However, you can access the file through the following link:

Feel free to explore the analysis!
